### Introduction
This is **[ownego]** source code. We want to public this source because there is nothing secret on this site, and with this source, everyone can know our coding style & the way we create it. Maybe somehow, this source code will inspire someone to make something special.

### Installation
Ok, so you can see the `src/` directory, that is main source we developed. To deploy, you need to install required platforms (`nodejs`, `bower`) and follow some steps below:
  - Type ```npm install``` to install nodejs packages.
  - Type ```bower install``` to install some third-party javascript libraries.
  - Then run `gulp`
  - Ok now you can open `index.html`, that's our site.

If you have any problem when deploy, feel free to contact with us via the contact form on [ownego].
It connects with our Slack so we can get your message directly.

### Version
1.0

### Tech

**ownego.com** uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [bower] - A package manager for the web
* [jQuery] - duh
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - Yes, we do
* And some third-party javascript libraries, you can find them in file `bower.json`

We have to say thanks to all open-source libraries to help us making this site more easier.
