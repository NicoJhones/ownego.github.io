            Starting to mess around with computers since middle school
            and with his special interest in numbers,
            Duc easily becomes ownego&#39;s savior whenever we encounter logical or algebraic problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            To Duc, every work can be done in just several hours of extreme concentration.
            He considers a perfect working environment cannot lack of music.
            You can easily find him on the office with his in-ear headphones, typing rapidly on his keyboard.
          </p>
          <p>
            One his concentration mode has turned on, even earthquake can hardly pull him out of his train of thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Probably those points explain why his hobby almost always require high concentration, like billiards.
            He challenges everyone in ownego whenever he has a chance,
            so it&#39;s better not to let him learn that you know how to play billiards (there&#39;s a high chance that you can win though).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Headphones destroyer:</strong> He has at least THREE in-ear headphones that has one side broken (and soon to be his newest lol)

            "Who is the most dedicated man in ownego?",
            there is only one answer to that question, it&#39;s "Minh".
            He would always try to perfect everything he&#39;s done and be responsible for his position.
            He&#39;s good in every field he knows, it&#39;s just that... he knows every field...
          </p>
          <p>
            Embodied in every product he created is his passion and responsibility,
            no one can complain anything about those completed products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever feeling stressed or encountering some strange bugs, he often sings some of his favorite melodies.
            This helps him, but not us, and after just about 5 minutes,
            we often have to plug in-ear headphones into our ear as a last resort.

            He&#39;s a man who&#39;s suitable for a job requiring creativity and high quality.
            He has a flexible mind and great problem solving skill...
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally he has a very open mind and let his mind explore
            new ideas from designing to other abstract concepts in physics,
            but once he starts to work, his mind becomes critical, thinking systematically to make the most optimal product.
            Every little problem must be addressed,
            to the point of nitpicking (in a good way of course).
            Because of that, everyone in the team is confident when working with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than designing, he also likes photography,
            playing soft &amp; slow solo melodies on his beloved guitar,
            and he especially love Hanoi.
            He seldom posts status on his facebook, but when he does,
            the chance of you seeing that post being related to Hanoi is pretty high, about 69%.
